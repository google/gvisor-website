The authoritative document for community resources and organization is the
[community repository][community], which contains the project's [governance
model][governance].  and [code of conduct][codeofconduct]. Individual
repositories have their own guidelines and processes for contributing. See the
[canonical list of repositories][repositories] for more information.

The project maintains two mailing lists:

 * [gvisor-users][gvisor-users] for accouncements and general discussion.
 * [gvisor-dev][gvisor-dev] for development and contribution.

The community calendar shows upcoming public meetings and opportunities to
collaborate.
