gVisor implements a large portion of the Linux surface and while we strive to
make it broadly compatible, there are (and always will be) unimplemented
features and bugs. The only real way to know if it will work is to try. If you
find a container that doesnâ€™t work and there is no known issue, please [file a
bug][bug] indicating the full command you used to run the image. You can view
open issues related to compatibility [here][issues].

If you're able to provide the [debug logs](../debugging/), the
problem likely to be fixed much faster.

## Debugging tools

Most common debugging utilities work. Note that some tools, such as tcpdump and
old versions of ping, require excplicitly enabling raw sockets via the unsafe
`--net-raw` runsc flag.  Specific tools include:
